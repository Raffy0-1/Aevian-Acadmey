              1. Information We Collect
            </h2>
            <p>
              We collect contact information from parents (name, email, phone) and basic educational indicators from students (grade level, date of birth, English level) during trial scheduling and portal registration.

              2. Student Safety & Video Recordings
            </h2>
            <p>
              Our live sessions are hosted in small groups and recorded to let parents review progress and to perform quality assurance checks. These recordings are securely stored and accessible only to matching parents, teachers, and admins.
            </p>
            <p>
              We do not share student profiles or live recording feeds with external third-party advertisers.
